## 1. What is this repo?

This repository contains a collection of Codespaces images.
Feel free to use them for yourself, in your new (or old) repository or use them as a starting point to make your own!
If you want to, you can send your tailored configs back as a PR into this repo for someone else to find.
You can find the images in `/.devcontainer/`.
That way, you can also create your codespace right out of this repo and GitHub will allow you to chose the image you want to use.
